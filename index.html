         <h1>Introduce Yourself</h1>
  <h2>Hi! My name is Olivia Malvar, but a lot of my friends call me Liv. I am currently a junior in the School of Computing and Information pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Digital Narrative & Interactive Design. I have a deep interest in UX/UI design and front-end development. Most of my courses this semester focus on these areas, as I believe it will be helpful for when I intern with PNC this summer as part of their digital design team! I am a brother of Kappa Theta Pi which is Pitt's co-ed professional technology fraternity and a sister of social sorority Sigma Delta Tau.

 <h1>Field of Study</h1>
  <h2>I have always been interested in computers, even when I was young. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology and up until recently, I have struggled to figure out what that would look like. After taking various courses in information science, I finally realized where my passion lies: UX/UI design and front-end development. I am excited to learn more about this field in my classes.</h2>

         <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product development? </h1>
  <h2>Before coming to college, I never realized how much thought actually went into designing products for users to have a pleasant experience. After learning such, I was fascinated by the entire process. Along with this class, I am also taking UX Engineering and Web Design this semester. I am interested to learn how UX design within product development differs from UX within user interfaces.</h2>

         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>After graduation, I am looking to pursue a career in UX/UI and front-end development. First and foremost, this career is important to me because I am passionate about it. I believe that if you are not passionate about what you do, you will not be successful. Happiness is key. Besides that, I understand how frustrating it is to navigate a poorly designed website. I would love to showcase my creativity by designing websites that are efficient for users.</h2>
